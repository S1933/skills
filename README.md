# Skills catalogue

A validated catalogue of portable and client-specific Agent Skills. The repository is in stabilization mode: improve existing skills and safety/evaluation coverage before proposing new functional skills.

| Skill | Invocation | Clients | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`adapter-pattern`](adapter-pattern/) | automatic | agent-skills | Use when one domain model must interoperate with multiple external APIs, file formats, providers, CLIs, storage engines, or versioned protocols without leaking vendor details into core logic. |
